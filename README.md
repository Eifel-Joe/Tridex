# Tridex
This modification is based on the official Voron Trident release files: https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident/releases/tag/Trident

It adds:

-350x250mm frame for use with 250x250mm build plate (~220x250mm printable area with two toolheads)

-IDEX toolheads

All files are in "beta" state--functional, but not complete. Use them at your own risk, no support is implied :)
